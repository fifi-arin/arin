    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>Since childhood, I never had the chance to know my biological father. My world revolved around my mom‚Äôs family, and they became my closest circle. I grew up with my grandparents, who were my constant companions when my mom was busy with work. It was just me, my brother, and our grandparents, creating a unique bond that shaped my upbringing.For a long time, I felt a sense of discomfort when I saw friends with what seemed like complete, traditional families. There was always a lingering feeling of being different. But over time, I came to realize that what I had was more than enough. My grandparents and my mom have always been my unwavering supporters, my foundation, and my safe space.I now see them as my true home ‚Äî the place where I belong, where love and acceptance are unconditional. I am deeply grateful to God for blessing me with the family I have. They are my strength, my guiding light, and my constant reminder that family is not defined by its structure, but by the love we share.</p>

    <h2>Highschool Friends</h2>
    <p>I've had friends since my high school days, and although I don't have many pictures with them, the memories we share are priceless. Even when life created distance between us‚Äîespecially during my toughest moments in upper grades when I was battling illness while preparing for SPM‚Äîthey never left my side. At my lowest point, when everything seemed overwhelming, they remained my unwavering supporters. Thanks to their constant encouragement and belief in me, I managed to overcome those challenges and graduate from secondary school. Their presence in my life is a reminder that true friendship goes beyond time, distance, and hardship.</p>

    <h2>Uni Friends</h2>
    <p>After completing my SPM, I was offered a place at UiTM Segamat through my UPU result. I chose my course based on my uncle's recommendation, as he believed it would suit me better since mathematics wasn‚Äôt my strongest subject. However, my true passion lies in creating websites and working with systems, a passion that began during my high school years when I took Science Computer. Learning the basics back then sparked my interest in technology and fueled my desire to pursue this field further.My university journey became even more memorable thanks to the friends I made along the way. By a twist of fate, all five of us ended up in rooms next to each other, and we quickly formed a bond that grew stronger over time. It wasn‚Äôt until our third semester that we truly became inseparable. The memories we created together are some of the best moments of my life, filled with laughter, support, and unforgettable experiences. I cherish every moment we spent together, and I hold my friends close to my heart. They have become my second family, and I am forever grateful for the love and joy they bring into my life.</p>
