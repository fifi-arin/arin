                <strong><li>Lesson Learned:</strong> 
                Working part-time in a health & beauty company taught me so much beyond the job itself. I learned how to really listen to people and understand their needs, which made me more confident in helping others. I picked up tips on time management, teamwork, and even business insights that I didn‚Äôt expect. Plus, I became more aware of self-care and the value of taking care of yourself. It wasn‚Äôt just about selling products, it was about personal growth, solving problems, and building meaningful connections.

                <strong><li>Learn Learned:</strong> Internships teach me valuable lessons in both personal and professional growth. You gain practical experience, learn to adapt to workplace culture, improve communication, and develop time management and problem-solving skills. Internships help apply theoretical knowledge in real-world settings, build confidence, and clarify career interests. Additionally, they offer networking opportunities, mentorship, and a better understanding of job expectations, ultimately preparing you for future career success.

            <p><strong><li>Event Purpose:</strong>This was the first event organized by our classmates outside UiTM, as we had this subject (IMD317) in our courses, in developing an event. Live, Laugh, Love: Unlocking Self Love, aims to connect organizations with the community to raise awareness, provide education, and address specific needs. It promotes inclusivity, empowers individuals, and inspires positive change by bridging knowledge gaps and offering learning opportunities. These programs enhance community well-being, create lasting impact, and encourage partnerships to address social, educational, or environmental issues.</li></p>
            <p>
                <strong><li>Learn Learned:</strong> It teaches valuable lessons about self-acceptance, mental well-being, and emotional resilience. Participants can learn how to build a positive self-image, manage stress, and practice self-care. We aims to promote self-awareness, improve confidence, and encourage individuals to cultivate healthier relationships with themselves and others. By embracing the concept of self-love, participants can unlock their potential, enhance their overall happiness, and contribute positively to their communities.
