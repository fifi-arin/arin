                    <p>Synopsis : “500 Days of Summer” is a film based on the relationship between a man and a woman in their mid-twenties. In the opening seen, the omniscient narrator warns the audience of the outcome of the story by stating, “This is not a love story.” The main characters, Tom and Summer, both work at a Greeting Card Company. Summer is a new employee, and Tom begins to fall in love with her quirky personality and physical attractiveness. Summer only wants to be Tom’s friend with no commitments, but she treats him as if she has more intentions. Tom and Summer become the best of friends, but they also act as if they are lovers. Because of this, Tom begins to fall even more in love with Summer. Summer tells Tom that they should have distance after a while but throws in the phrase, “But you are still my best friend.” This breaks Tom’s heart. After some time, Tom meets with her again, and he still has hope that they will end up together. To his disappointment, he finds that she is in engaged to another man. Towards the end of the film, Summer finds Tom at the park, and she tells him that she is now married. At the very end, Tom is attending a job interview, and he asks a girl on a date who’s name (coincidently) happen to be “Autumn”.</p>

                    <p> Personal thoughts:Why would I say it was a horror ? This movie just shows how we as human may be different from each other, but we get stuck with how we potray we needs to be loved. Instead of someone that shows and guide you their love. I cant get over this movie, it's so good.</p>

                    <p> Personal thoughts: Ouh! Its my favourite scene btw. This one harddddddd. I love.... love,love,love,love,LOVEE, how its a perfect blend of comedy, romance, and full of life lesson. The movie breaks away from typical rom-com clichés by putting both characters in a game of deception, making their interactions unpredictable and wildly entertaining. It's just scared me how a person could do all of this just for a BET. YUP LIKEEE ??? anyway, its my favourite also, sooo give it a watch !</p>
